# Rust influence

The author and his presentations use/are about [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/) language. Hence we

- include editor/IDE settings, like [VS Code settings](.vscode/),
- [.gitignore](.gitignore) editor/IDE/extension-specific files that we don't want to include (like
  [.vscrof](.vscrof))
- honor Rust [style](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md) and
  default `cargo fmt` [formatting](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.5.1&search=),
  such as [max. line length](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.5.1&search=#max_width)
  being `100`.

Suggest VS Code and extensions (TODO)
