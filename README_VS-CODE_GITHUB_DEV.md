Unfortunately, `rust-analyzer` VS Code extension is [not available for VS Code
web](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/11309), any unlikely anytime soon (but please
give it [thumbs up](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/11309)). So you won't be able
to see any inferred variable types or function parameter names in VS Code web.
