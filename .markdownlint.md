# Markdown Lint rules

For use with [Markdown Lint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint) for VS Code. The
following describes reasons for overrides in [`.markdownlint.json`](.markdownlint.json):

- [`MD013` line-length](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md#md013) -
  changed to `100`. It's disabled by default (as per [Markdown Lint
  Config](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint#configure)). But it seems that because
  we have our own `.markdownlint.json`, the default config doesn't apply.
  
  Why `100`? Because the author loves [Rust](). And by default, Rust's [`cargo
  fmt`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.5.1&search=#max_width) formats lines to
  `100`
- [`MD051` link-fragments](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md#md051)
  - changed to false. That's because [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) URL's to specific slides use
    anchors/hash `#`. But the target anchors don't exist in Markdown files nor in `index.html`. The
    anchors are generated by Reveal.js itself.
