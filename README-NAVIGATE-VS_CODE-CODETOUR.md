This is how to run the same steps (as in the videos) in your (installed) VS Code with `CodeTour`
extension. (Unfortunately, this works with local VS Code only. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with
VS Code web/GitHub web until `CodeTour` publishes its version `0.0.59` or newer on Marketplace - see
"Related Issues" slide <a class="hide_with_reveal_js"
href="README-RELATED-ISSUES.md">README-RELATED-ISSUES.md</span> and give them thumbs up.)

You need version `0.0.59` or newer. Unfortunately, as of September 2022, such a version is not
available on [VS Code
Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour).

You can either

1. download v. `0.0.59` (or newer) from [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org) >
   [CodeTour](https://open-vsx.org/extension/vsls-contrib/codetour) > "DOWNLOAD"
2. `code --install-extension vsls-contrib.codetour-0.0.59.vsix` (or newer)

OR

1. `git clone` [`microsoft/codetour`](https://github.com/microsoft/codetour)
2. install [`VSCE` - Visual Studio Code Extension
   Manager](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce). On Manjaro/Arch Linux suggest NOT to install
   `VSCE` with `npm`, but with the OS's `pacman` or "Add/Remove Software" (as from
   [AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vsce)).

Suggest also installing
[rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).
